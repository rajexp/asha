Each view exists within the views.py file 
as a series of individual functions.
Each view takes at least one argument - a HttpRequest object which lies in django.http module
each view must return a HttpResponse object
HttpResponse take a string parameter represent content of page the client requested for.
To create URL mapping , we use a tuple. For Django to pick your mappings up, this tuple must be called urlpatterns.
The urlpatterns tuple contains a series of calls to the django.conf.urls.url() function, with each call handling 
a unique mapping. 
name parameter is optional  provided by Django to allow you to distinguish one mapping from another.
A separate urls.py file for each application allows you to set URLs for individual applications. With minimal 
coupling, you can then join them up to your project’s master urls.py file later.
